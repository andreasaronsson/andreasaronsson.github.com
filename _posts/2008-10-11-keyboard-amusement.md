================

When you grow up with Gentoo, you mostly only ever need to use the ``loadkeys`` command in the console. This led me to believe that there only existed one command to change the layout you're currently using. Now I know better (like five years or so after learning about loadkeys...): ``loadkeys`` are for console only. ``setxkbmap`` is what you use for switching in X. You'll see below what finally made this obvious to me, or rather what I was doing when I realized it.

Since I guess many people being computer literate have a tendency towards perfectionism in one way or another this is certainly the case with me. Knowing that the keyboard layout with the completely dominating installed base; "qwerty" has an inherently flawed (for what we're using it for today) design in the first place, it kind of annoys me that I've not yet gotten myself to learn a reasonably good keyboard layout design such as svorak. This is a swedish variant of dvorak since I need to type swedish letters from most every day. Now, there are obstacles for making this transition such as finding a hardwired keyboard or having to paint the letters by hand. But I think I might have come up with a better solution:

Yeah, desktop background is a tiled picture of the keyboard layout. This was I can always peek at it while I type. I'm probably going to make a dvorak-se one since it appears to have more appeal to a programmer like me with better placement of brackets as the primary treat (like the original dvorak).
