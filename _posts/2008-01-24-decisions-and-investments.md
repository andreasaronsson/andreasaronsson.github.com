================

Through the years I have met a number of colleagues with leadership tasks and managers. More often
than not I've been left wondering how on earth they managed to trick their way into that position or
fooled themselves that they are fit for the task for that matter. 

How is it possible to weed out the unfit-for-management individuals? In the following thext I'm
trying to make a couple of valid remarks.

First off, business is about making money. If you don't make any money off of it, it's not worth
it. This is something I believe is important to keep in mind at all times no matter how belligerent
your situation at hand might be. As always reality is never black and white and it's certainly
possible to argue that some departments and/or customers are quite important for the organization as
a whole without being profitable as such. 
One key factor in making successful business is to keep customer focus (yes I know it's marketspeak
but the core values are important in the point I am trying to make here) and always strive to exceed
the expectations. A makeshift mental map to achieve this is to try to find out what the expectations
actually are (empathic abilities are a great help here), and then try to satisfy and surpass them in
a manner that is affordable. 
That said, how to we go on making good business decisions? One very common decision making task in
management is to decide whether to make an investment or not. A very customary way to go about it (as
far as my experiences tell me) is to reason something like "if I don't spend any money I do not make
an error, hence I am safe". This is driven by fear and that is seldom a Good Thing (that's a topic
in itself which I will save for another day). Instead, it's vital that you're able to reason about
your investment and draw a conclusion whether it's a valid investment and if it's going to save you
some money in the medium to long perspective. Again, it's not that simple but to be able to make a
point, it's essential to exaggerate the contrasts. A relly simple example; let's say that you have a
bunch of computers running a site for you; the PSU retailers start vending a new standard that
consumes way less power than the old ones. Calculating the price of the reduced power consumption
versus the new hardware investment and costs for downtime and work hours spent is really a trivial
task but the average (or sub par rather) managers I've met does not even bother making that
calculation. Instead, it's an intuitive negative reaction to the investment. 
This brings me to the main point in this post; I've myself used the simplification (in this text
even) of reality to be able to make good time in order to create deliverables at all. Again, this is
a good way to discern individuals with the ability to take on the responsibilities of managerial
tasks. This can of course be imposed due to extreme time shortage but generally it's a good sign
that you just don't cut it. More superficial signs to look for would be a tendency to bring  too little
attention to details and too much focus on the short term effects of decisions (again intuitive and
puts demands on your judgmental abilities).
