title: "How anal am I? "
---

I just found myself asking me that question. Allright, I am a nerd and I'm fine with that. Allright, I'm very persistent about orderliness and I've come to accept that as a part of my personality. Now, when using the commandline and bash in particular and you've written a command that you decide that you don't want to execute, how do you go about clearing the cli row? Out of the possibilities I know I could choose ``CTRL+c`` which would be kinda natural and quite easy to type too. A perfectly fine alternative. But *no*. There's another way to go about it; ``CTRL+u``. A command which tells bash to  *erase* to the beginning of the line. I <strong>feels</strong> alot better. You <strong>erase</strong> the characters you don't want, no sloppy discard-all-in-one. And it's important to me. Really. I keep my ``~/tmp`` clean with reasonably regular intervals. Really not needed either. These are not the only examples. Randomness and disorder should be the the state which demands the least energy to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy">maintain</a>, no?  Sometimes I wonder from whence the impetus originates...
