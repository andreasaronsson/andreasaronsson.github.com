All aspects of functional features in programming languages are interesting.
This makes [JAVASLANG](http://www.javaslang.io) intriguing. I have spent some
time reading up on it. I think that it could give some of the advantages of
[Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org/) without some of the drawbacks.

Quite often when I write something these days I feel the urge to try it with
JAVASLANG. I am especially interested in two things. To see how hard it is to
make it play nice with other parts of the vast Java ecosystem and how usage
affects compile times. Both things are pretty severe drawbacks with Scala
(especially compile times).

So far I am getting the notion that compile times are longer. I have
done no measurements so I won't take that to heart. You can find one of my
experiments where most nice things are nowadays;
