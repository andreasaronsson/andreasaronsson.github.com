Bought myself a couple of new disks.
I want redundancy on the servers and now my economy has caught up with my needs.
One of them is the latest WD Raptor.
I wanted that one for the workstation so i ended up dd'ing the windows partition.
Then I makde a new filesystem (ext3 with journal_data_writeback for speed) for my gentoo installation.
Using dd to copy the MBR apparently wasn't enough (or maybe I didn't copy enough bytes).
Therefore I had to boot with a livecd and run grub from there.
But it's all good now and I can use the old disk for my new RAID1 installation of the server running this site.
This weekend I'll setup the file server with a RAID1 too.
Time for the hero to go to bed.
