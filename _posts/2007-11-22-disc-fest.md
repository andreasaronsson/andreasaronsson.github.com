================

Bought myself a couple of new disks. I want redundancy on the servers and now my economy has caught up with my needs. One of them is the latest WD Raptor and I wanted that one for the workstation so i ended up dd'ing the windows partition and making a new filesystem (ext3 with journal_data_writeback for speed) for my gentoo installation. Using dd to copy the MBR apparently wasn't enough (or maybe I didn't copy enough bytes) so i had to boot with a livecd and run grub from there. But it's all good now and I can use the old disk for my new RAID1 installation of the server running this site. This weekend I'll setup the fileserver with a RAID1 too. 
Time for the hero to go to bed.
