Want a todo list with checkboxes?

First make a new heading with the usual Alt+Enter Then, start a list
by typing hyphen (-) Next, use S-M-Enter (SHIFT + Alt + Enter) for as
many times as you need stuff to check off.  Use the Ctrl-c-c to tick
items off. Then you end up with pretty stuff like this:

    ** TODO stuff to act
      - [ ] add a schmerdiferd
      - [ ] to go the fafofa
      - [ ] make the ahaaa

All lovely colorized. I love this stuff! Thank you thank you thank you
to the org mode devs!Â
