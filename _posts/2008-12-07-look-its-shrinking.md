That's how I percieve what happens when I start to understand a subject.
First contact with a software project or product is often daunting in my mind.
There are so many details that your working memory rapidly becomes overloaded.
After some time, your brain manages to do what it does best. 
Filtering the avalanche of data.
Effectively extracts only what's needed for the conscious part of the mind.
To make sense of the object of our interest.
What happens is that a complex environment transforms into something more controllable.
When I first started to take an interest in computers and operating systems, replacing the hardware in my server seemed complicated.
With the experience I have now it seems a simple matter of adding some modules in the kernel config and then replacing the hardware.
Afterwards recompile the Gentoo system with some adjusted choices in the CFLAGS.
The domain of software development is very much about handling complexity.
The above mentioned process. Of converting a set of data into something more malleable. In the mind is something I notice that many software developers ignore when they are to explain something for their peers.
To be understood. You who have the knowledge will have to consider the experience level and knowledge about the subject in the recipient's possession.
