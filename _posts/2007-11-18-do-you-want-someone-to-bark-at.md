Some people, more often than not they are performing managerial tasks but that's by no means a rule, claim that software somehow
gets better and more trustworthy because they can lift the phone, dial a number and bark at some person on the other end. Well, I
can't honestly say I've bought that many copies of microsoft licenses but I have had the urge to bark more than once when dealing
with their software. However, anyone honestly believing that my disappointments aired with them would in any way affect their next
release? I do not.  Better then would be to use software that allow you to modify it at your own leisure. Don't know how to write
code? There are plenty of people who do. Many of them are interested in working and major efforts go into software every day just
because of the enjoyment.  So, instead of barking at software vendors, go drive a car and bark in there.  Ending with a quote from a
slashdot poster:

**If you are betting your business on software, you better have the source, otherwise you are a hostage.**
