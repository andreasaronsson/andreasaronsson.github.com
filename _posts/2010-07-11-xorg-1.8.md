Upgrading to xorg-server with USE=-hal appeared to make things run a
tad faster.  However, some really strange behavior with keypress
events started to occur. I tried several different variants for
keyboard layout, setting special keys etc but I still got stuff like
"right ctrl is return" or "arrow down inserts a space and line
down". Adding to xorg.conf:


    Section "InputClass"
    Identifier "keyboard-all"
    Driver "evdev"
    Option "XkbLayout" "se"
    Option "XkbVariant" ",qwerty"
    MatchIsKeyboard "on"
    EndSection


Made it work again. I was under the impression that you would have to
configure less in xorg.conf after upgrading. But hey X works all dandy
now.
