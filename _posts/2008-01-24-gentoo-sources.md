I have to say my impression is that the gentoo devs maintaining the
kernel sources does a damn fine job. New versions appears in the three
at a very nice rate and keeping up with the relentless pace of
vanilla. At the time of this writing the latest stable kernel is
2.6.23.14 and portage just gave me 2.6.23-gentoo-r6. Good stuff. I've
been compiling gentoo-sources for a few years now and it has never
been smoother. A simple

``emerge -Nqa world``

 * copy the old .config to the new source dir
 * swap the symlink

``make oldconfig``

Then run my dead simple shell script:

{% highlight bash linenos %}
#!/bin/sh
mount /boot
cd /usr/src/linux
make && make modules_install
mv /boot/bzImage /boot/bzImage.bak
cp /usr/src/linux/arch/x86_64/boot/bzImage /boot
cp /usr/src/linux/.config /boot/dotconfigurebackup
cp /usr/src/linux/System.map /boot/System.map
umount /boot
{% endhighlight %}

PenettoÂ´</a> with which I agree and future setups will follow that.
Next, reboot. Very much hassle free, almost too good as the main
reason my choosing gentoo is to learn stuff ;-) The smooth operation
and this interesting read:
http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/kernel/maintenance.xml makes me even
more keen on gentoo.  <a

it'. The more the merrier and he certainly contributes in a positive
manner.
