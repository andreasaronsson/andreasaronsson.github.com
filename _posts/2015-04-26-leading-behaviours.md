Here are some thoughts on desirable behavioural patterns for developers.

At first I was thinking about writing about anti-patterns in behaviour or
anti-behaviours. That would be instant irony. Anyways, seeing
[this clever tweet](https://twitter.com/shawnbut/status/591230483117244417) made
me think and the term for this would be **Leading Behaviours**. An idea here is
to coin the terms **Leading Patterns** and **Leading Behaviours**. Using the
word 'leading' signals that they may not be leading forever which I believe is
true for both terms. Juxtaposed to "best" - there can only be one best and one
does not expect best to change. Not as frequent anyways.

Desirable consequences of **Leading Behaviours** would be to inspire others,
energize others and in general be supportive. It should only in a way that
promotes other developers to adopt **Leading Behaviours**.
[This proverb](http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/give-a-man-a-fish.html) is one
example of how one could practice leading behaviours.

Fearlessness
------------

In a balanced approach to solving problems fear will play a small role.
Especially true in problem domains new to the individual. This enables
developers to try out practices and tools. This is essential when striving to
work at as high an abstraction level as possible. It will also be a great help
to make pragmatic and earthbound decisions. It will make it easier to
concentrate on doing the most important things rather than some peripheral
issue. Time is spent on what is most important to a larger degree.

Detached decision making
------------------------

Anything an individual invests much time and energy into will have a profound
effect on that person. Staying emotionally detached allows the developer to stay
rational. It will make it easier to avoid
[logical fallacies](http://www.logicalfallacies.info/) when reasoning. It is
highly beneficial to know these by heart. This enables one to avoid wasting time
an navigate successfully in many different contexts. Aptness to take into
account all relevant factors is important. Likewize is realizing that it is very
common with trade offs when making choices. A mind very open to new information
allows rapid stance changes as any significant new information is presented.
Previous experiences and only a real help when there is no other path of
reasoning available. This is more and more true in a world where change is one
of the ever fewer constants. More important to make novel deductions from the
current set if variables.

Emotional involvement
---------------------

Various emotions and feelings are the impetus behind our actions. Perhaps the
most potent character trait of them all is passion for our field of work. This
makes developers spend that extra time and energy. This enables them to delve
deeper and excel at whatever is needed to grow mentally to be able to grasp the
most enigmatic concepts. Being dissatisfied and looking for ways to improve
written and code not yet written is the hallmark of a developer that will learn
massive amounts during a career. A sign of maturity is where there is a complete
objectiveness when evaluating code. Self awareness is priceless here.
