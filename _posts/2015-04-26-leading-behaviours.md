Leading Behaviours
==================

Here are some thoughts on desirable behavioural patterns for developers.

At first I was thinking about writing about anti-patterns in behaviour or anti-behaviours. That would be instant irony. Kinda
funny. Anyways, seeing [this clever tweet](https://twitter.com/shawnbut/status/591230483117244417) made me think and the term for
this would be **Leading Behaviours**. In the software development industry we could make an attempt to coin the terms **Leading
Patterns** and **Leading Behaviours**. Using leading signals that they may not be leading forever which I believe is true for both
terms. Juxtaposed to "best" - there can only be one best and one does not expect best to change. Not as frequently anyways.

Desirable consequences of **Leading Behaviours** would be to inspire others, energize others and in general be supportive but only
in a way that promotes other developers to adopt **Leading
Behaviours**. [This proverb](http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/give-a-man-a-fish.html) is one example of how one could incorporate
a thought when practicing leading behaviours.

Fearlessness
------------

In a balanced approach to solving problems, especially in novel domains, fear will play a quite small role. This enables developers
to try out practices and tools new to them. This is essential when striving to work at as high an abstraction level as possible. It
will also be a great help to make pragmatic and earthbound decisions. It will make it easier to concentrate on doing the most
important things rather than some peripheral issue. Time is spent on what is most important to a larger degree. 

Detached decision making
------------------------

Anything an individual invests much time and energy into will affect that person profoundly. Being able to mold this into a one way
relation allows the developer to stay rational when making decisions. It will make it easier to avoid
[logical fallacies](http://www.logicalfallacies.info/) when reasoning. It is highly beneficial to know these by heart to achieve a
level of reasoning that can navigate successfully in many different contexts. Some examples of thought patterns this leads to are
aptness to take into account all relevant factors or realizing that it is very common with trade offs when selecting implementations
or tools or processes etc. Being open to new information to the point where instant U turns can be made the very second any
significant new information is presented. Previous experiences and only a real help when there is no other path of reasoning
available. This is more and more true in a world where change is one of the ever fewer constants. More important to make novel
deductions from the current set if variables.

Emotional involvement
---------------------

Various emotions and feelings are the impetus behind our actions. Looking at an entire career for a software developer perhaps the
most potent character trait of them all is passion for our field of work. This makes developers spend that extra time and thought
energy to delve deeper and excel at whatever is needed to grow mentally to be able to grasp the most enigmatic concepts. Constantly
being dissatisfied and tirelessly looking for ways to improve written and yet to be written code is the hallmark of a developer that
will learn massive amount during a career. A good sign of maturity is where there is a complete objectiveness about all code,
including code that is written by oneself. It will be scrutinized harsher than other code.
