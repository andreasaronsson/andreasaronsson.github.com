Looking again at the [Stack Overflow Developer Survey Results](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/).
It is possible to calculate a trend for "Developed for Platform" category.
'win' for Windows Desktop or server depending on year.

```
| Year | other|  win |
|------|------|------|
| 2013 | 38.6 | 61.4 |
| 2014 | 41.2 | 58.8 |
| 2015 | 42.0 | 58.0 |
| 2016 | 47.9 | 52.1 |
| 2017 | 59.0 | 41.0 |
| 2018 | 64.8 | 35.2 |
```

In a five years almost half of the share is gone. 

The [bash on windows improvement](http://venturebeat.com/2016/03/30/microsoft-is-bringing-the-bash-shell-to-windows/) allows more developers to use Windows while developing for other platforms. 
At the same time [more Microsoft things are being ported to linux](https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-working-on-porting-sysinternals-to-linux/).

NTFS is still the biggest gripe. 
Along with very slow search and system updates.
