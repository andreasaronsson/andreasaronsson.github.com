Looking at the
[Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2016 Results](http://stackoverflow.com/research/developer-survey-2016)
it is possible to calculate a trend. Taking some of the figures and putting them
in an orgmode document (which is also a spreadsheet if one wishes) renders the
following table:

```
| Year | *nix |  win |
|------+------+------|
| 2013 | 38.6 | 61.4 |
| 2014 | 41.2 | 58.8 |
| 2015 |  42. |   58 |
| 2016 | 47.9 | 52.1 |
```

In a few years the developer share drops nearly ten percent.
[Developers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vhh_GeBPOhs) not so much. One can
suspect that this triggered the recent
[bash on windows improvement](http://venturebeat.com/2016/03/30/microsoft-is-bringing-the-bash-shell-to-windows/)
whis is excellent and will be a relief for many developers. 

If they replaced the NTFS file system with something better
[and some other things](http://itvision.altervista.org/why-windows-10-sucks.html)
it starts looking really interesting.
