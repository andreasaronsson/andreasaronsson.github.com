More [JAVASLANG](http://www.javaslang.io) kata!
Last time it was [Bank OCR](https://andreasaronsson.github.io/programming/2016/06/19/bank-ocr-kata)
This time the [Roman Numerals](http://codingdojo.org/kata/RomanNumerals/).
Some usage of property based testing.
Rare cases seems hard to catch with property based testing.
Perhaps this is something I will learn to overcome when I become more proficient.
